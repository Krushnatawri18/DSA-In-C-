/*
Given an array ‘ARR’ of ‘N’ integers, where all the elements occur an even number of times and only one number occurs an odd number of times.
Find and return the number which occurs an odd number of times.

For example:
'N' = 5, 'ARR' = [1, 2, 3, 2, 3]
Output: 1
Except for number 1, all numbers occur an even number of times.

TC - O(N)
SC - O(1)

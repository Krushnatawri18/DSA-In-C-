/*
Given a singly linked list and an integer x.Delete xth node from the singly linked list.

Example 1:
Input: 1 -> 3 -> 4 
x = 3
Output: 1 -> 3
Explanation:
After deleting the node at 3rd position (1-base indexing), the linked list is as 1 -> 3. 

Example 2:
Input: 1 -> 5 -> 2 -> 9 
x = 2
Output: 1 -> 2 -> 9
Explanation: 
After deleting the node at 2nd position (1-based indexing), the linked list is as 1 -> 2 -> 9.
